Possible execution flows:
Exceptionals:
    - User presses an operation button without having written an operand before (just started calculator)
    - User presses equals without having written an operand of after written first operand
    In any case, nothing happens
Normal flow:
    1. User presses a number button, number is shown on display.
    2. User presses an operation button, operation is defined but not shown on display.
    3. User presses a number button, number is shown on display. Operation is ready to be executed.
    4. Uses presses equals button, operation is executed.
    5. Result is shown on display.
Alternate flow 1, resumes from 4 (replaces from that step):
    4.1. User presses operation button (second operand has already been resumed)
    4.2. Previous operation is executed and result is shown on display.
    4.3. Previos result is used as first operand for new operation.
    4.4. Resumes normal flow from 3.
Alternate flow 2:
    3.1. User presses operation button again.
    3.2. Previously defined operator is replaced by newly pressed button.
    3.3. Resumes normal flow from 3.
Alternate flow 3, happens after normal flow:
    5.1. User presses operation button.
    5.2. Previous operation result is used as first operand.
    5.3. Resumes normal flow from 3.
